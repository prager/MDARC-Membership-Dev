        <p>At this time it is still in early testing stage and it has not been released to the public yet. However, as of now, it is able to provide membership status for its members such as whether or not they are current with their dues.
        <p>As the first thing after the Portal is released to the public, the members will be able to update their data such as callsigns, addresses, names and add or delete their family members, who are also members of the Club.
